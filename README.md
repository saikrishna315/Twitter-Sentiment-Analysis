In this project, we have performed the following tasks:

1.	Collected twitter data (tweets) related to “cricket” in Json format by running code in python using streaming API.
2.	Developed the environment IntelliJ for Scala and Spark development. 
3.	Implemented five analytical queries for analysis of the collected data.
4.	Among five queries we implemented two queries using Spark RDD and another two using Spark Dataframes(where we executed join function using one of the hash tags from twitter) and one query which calls public API to update the collected data.
